# Enable DevSecOps with Azure and GitHub

DevSecOps, sometimes called Secure DevOps, builds on the principles of [DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/) but adds an increased focus on security. With DevSecOps, security becomes a central part of the entire lifecycle of the application, and it’s required that every team and person working on an application considers security. We call this concept “shift-left security”: moving the security thinking from something that is only for production, to something that’s relevant from the early stages of planning and development. 

Microsoft and GitHub offer solutions to have confidence in the code you’re running in production, by inspecting your code and allowing its traceability down to the work items and insights on the third-party components that are in use. 

## Secure your code with GitHub

With code scanning, developers can quickly and automatically analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors.

You can use code scanning to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code. Code scanning also prevents developers from introducing new problems. You can schedule scans for specific days and times, or trigger scans when a specific event occurs in the repository, such as a push. You can also track your repository's dependencies and receive security alerts when GitHub detects vulnerable dependencies.
